# Terms of Service

Last Updated: 05 December 2021<br>
Looking for the [privacy policy?](https://github.com/CarelessInternet/NodeBot/blob/main/privacy_policy.md)<br>
By using the NodeBot service, you are agreeing to both the privacy policy and terms of service (ToS). The ToS may be changed at any moment without notice. You are also agreeing to be over 13 years old, the minimum age requirement to use Discord.

## Language

- `NodeBot` refers to any contributors that have contributed to the NodeBot project.
- `NodeBot service` refers to the NodeBot bot.
- `You` refers to you, the user, using NodeBot.

## Content in Commands

Some commands may echo back content in one way or another. These include the following commands: `qrcode` (context menu & command interaction), `spotify` (context menu & command interaction), `translate`, `say`, `poll`, and `weather`. The NodeBot service and NodeBot may not filter, verify, approve, nor endorse content being sent to these commands. You, the user, are responsible for the content you have delivered to these commands, along with any results that have been affected by the content.'

## API Commands

Similar to the previous topic, you are held responsible for any content delivered to the API endpoints, as the NodeBot service does not filter any content delivered.

## Economy Commands

As obvious as it may be, NodeBot and the NodeBot service does not condone any illegal nor negative activity presented in any of the economy commands. It's just meant for fun.

## Records in Database

The core owner of the NodeBot service has the right to delete records from the database without warning, if the Discord server is found to be violating including but not limited to: laws and/or terms of service. These actions are irreversible.
