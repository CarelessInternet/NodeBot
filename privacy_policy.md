## What do you mean by "Discord Data?"

From the official [Discord Developer Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy):
> “Discord Data” means any and all data you obtain through the APIs.

# Privacy Policy

## What Discord Data do you collect?

As of right now, NodeBot collects the following Discord Data on success and if it isn't already stored:
- Economy Commands:
  * User ID
  * Guild ID

## What other data is collected/created/modified?

As of right now, NodeBot collects/creates/modifies the following data on success:

- Economy Commands:
  * Time of first command usage (this is not Discord Data, since the bot just takes the current time)
  * Cash & Bank Money (the bot automatically creates and handles these for you)
- Blacklisting Commands:
  * Time of blacklist (again, this is not Discord Data, since the bot just takes the current time)

## Why do you need the data?

All of the data collected is required to keep the economy commands functioning as expected.

## How do you use the data?

Economy data may be used to tell different users apart, and keep track of money.<br>
All data stored is displayed to the user and others in the Discord server through different commands in one way or another, so no data is kept secret.

## How long is the data stored for?

Economy data remains permanently.

## Do you share any data to companies or other people?

No data is shared with anyone or any companies.

## How can users contact you if they have concerns about your bot?

They may join the official support server, or open an issue on GitHub.

## How can users have their data removed?

Again, they may join the official support server, or open an issue on GitHub clarifying why they want the data removed.
