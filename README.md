<strong>ATTENTION:</strong> the prefix for this repository is <strong>..!</strong> but in production it's <strong>..</strong><br>
this code is currently in production, but will soon be upgraded to discord.js v13 (interaction branch) code when the hosting company adds nodejs version 16.6.0 or higher

forgive me for the dumpster fire i made whilst making the bot. too many unnecessary async awaits and bad code practices

also the memes in pictures/memes folder is ignored because there is no need to see all of the memes, you just need the code

i might fix the code in the future, idk, depends how popular the bot gets
